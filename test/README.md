## Testing

Right now, all the testing is transient, so no Jest or any automated testing tool.
We'll be testing manually until all the migration of the project is done, and then
we might start using a testing library if the project is stable enough for not doing big refactors for a while.

## Manual Testing

Every manual tests consists of a set of instructions, the input data, and the expected result. If the result is not the expected, something is not working fine.
This is similar to a Quality Assurance process.
